        <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold">Fees and Payments</h2>
        <p className="mt-2">
        You agree that Your Face AI provide you immediate access to digital content and begins service consumption immediately upon purchase, without the standard 14-day withdrawal period. Therefore, you expressly waive your right to withdraw from this purchase. Due to the high costs of GPU processing, we're not able to offer refunds because we reserve servers and incur high costs for your usage immediately. The subscription will be automatically renewed for the same period of time after the agreed term. If you do not wish to renew your subscription in the end of the term, you should cancel prior to the renewal date of your subscription.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
        Your Face AI offers a paid Service. You can sign up for a monthly or yearly subscription, that will automatically renew on a monthly or yearly basis. You can stop using the Service and cancel your subscription at any time through the website (click Billing). If you cancel your subscription, you will not receive a refund or credit for any amounts that have already been billed or paid. Your Face AI reserve the right to change its prices and offering (like credits or models) at any time. If you are on a subscription plan, changes to pricing will not apply until your next renewal.
        </p>
        <p className="mt-2">
        Unless otherwise stated, your subscription fees (“Fees”) do not include federal, state, local, and foreign taxes, duties, and other similar assessments (“Taxes”). You are responsible for all Taxes associated with your purchase and we may invoice you for such Taxes. You agree to timely pay such Taxes and provide us with documentation showing the payment or additional evidence that we may reasonably require. If any amount of your Fees are past due, we may suspend your access to the Services after we provide you written notice of late payment. You may not create more than one account to benefit from the Free tier of our Services. If we believe you are not using the Free tier in good faith, we may charge you standard fees or stop providing access to the Services.
